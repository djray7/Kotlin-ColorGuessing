# Overview
# Color Guessing game
I wanted to choose something simple and fun that would give me a basic understanding of the Kotlin language. 

This is a game that presents two colors. The user responds with the correct colors that comes from mixing the two. The game loops through until the user answers all the questions correctly. The code is set up so that more levels can be added to add difficulty. 

This could be a fun code for elementary school aged children learning the colors. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
